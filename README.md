Welcome to c0re! It's a game about providing a network connection to a whole world.\
You will have to write code, simplified of course :), to work with console with a few commands from **linux**. There's fully working file system inside an application! You can search something in Internet using this app!\
This application can be called very simple emulator if an operating system.\
By the way, in order to save state of game it's not enough to simply exit - you need to write `shutdown` in console

Here is a few screenshots of a game ^_^
